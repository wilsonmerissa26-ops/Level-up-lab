# Next implementation slices

1. **Implemented in Patch D:** Track B local persistence/usability: per-answer persistence, draft autosave, manual Save, Save & Exit, crash/reload recovery, backup/restore, serialized writes, and fail-stop transitions.
2. **Implemented in Patch E:** fresh deterministic Track B Day 2 / Day 7 / Day 21 delayed-retrieval reviews with transfer evidence, retry-safe evidence IDs, and memory-layer updates only.
3. **Implemented in Patch F:** deterministic Track A three-probe rules, two-probe verification, prerequisite tracing, prior-instruction protection, lifecycle guards, and the delayed-retrieval + transfer mastery requirement.
4. **Implemented in Patch G:** controlled Track A diagnostic delivery and formal evidence adapter with raw response, assistance, access, freshness, reliability, and prior-instruction provenance.
5. **Implemented in Patch H:** adaptive prerequisite routing, targeted Track B repair, explicit component verification, and two fresh formal verification probes before `PROVISIONAL`.
6. **Implemented in Patch I:** formal Day 2 and Day 7 delayed retrieval, separate transfer checks, guarded `PROVISIONAL → MASTERED`, Day 21 maintenance, controlled-miss repair/retry, and unusable-probe replacement.
7. **Implemented in Patches J–L:** release-integrity hardening, schema/revision durability, storage-mode handling, explicit recovery decisions, and primary-missing mirror protection.
8. **Target-device persistence gate passed for the current pilot environment:** iPad Home Screen / standalone passed non-reload, crash/reload, mirror recovery, persistent-storage grant, full app close/reopen, and full iPad restart. Regular Safari tab remains best-effort and is not the preferred pilot environment.
9. **Patch M next:** run the synthetic end-to-end learner-path smoke test in the cleared iPad Home Screen environment. Michael remains blocked until the synthetic browser smoke passes.
10. **After Patch M browser pass:** deliberately switch student runtime on for Michael's iPad-only pilot.
11. **Patch O foundation implemented:** reusable Pilot Learner Blueprint, learner-specific isolation keys, clean starter-state generation, adaptive/neurodivergent learning preferences, Interest Worlds, Low-Stimulation availability, and guarded new-learner transfer packages. Michael remains an isolated learner instance. Full runtime UI extraction remains a separate audited slice.
12. Add ELA, Social Studies, Study Coach, and School Success / School Radar modules.
13. Add SAT, Essay Coach, Scholarship Discovery, and college-planning modules as reusable Level-Up modules.
14. Add managed cloud persistence later when cross-device sync, off-device recovery, or commercial scale requires it. Until then, the supported pilot environment is the installed iPad Home Screen app.

No real learner records, credentials, or school-session secrets belong in Git.
